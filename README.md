## Introduction

Fuzion is a simple and easy way to deploy and manage zkSync Paymasters. It is a web application that allows users to deploy and manage Paymasters on zkSync in a few clicks.

## Inspiration

I found that most of the projects just use the basic paymaster provided by zkSync. I wanted to create a simple and easy way to deploy and manage Paymasters and make more developers use paymasters in a more easy way.

## Features

### Deploy Paymaster

Deploy Paymaster on zkSync with a few clicks. Just enter the required details and click on the create button.

### Manage Paymaster

Deployed Paymasters can be managed easily. You can view the details of the Paymaster and also update the Paymaster.

### Modular access control

(WIP)
